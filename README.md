Vorssaint Utils keeps your Mac awake on demand, shows the system readings that
actually matter, inverts mouse wheel scrolling without touching the trackpad,
and replaces ⌘Tab with a window switcher that shows real thumbnails.
100% native (SwiftUI + AppKit), bilingual (en-US / pt-BR), no Electron, no
analytics, no network calls.

## Features

### ⚡ Keep awake
- Toggle from the panel, the right-click menu or the global shortcut **⌃⌥⌘K**
- Sessions from 15 min to 8 h, or indefinite, with +15/+30/+60 min extensions
- The display stays on while a session is active
- **Closed-lid mode**: keep a MacBook running with the lid shut
  (`pmset disablesleep`, automatically reverted when the session ends, the app
  quits or after a crash)
- **Optional password-free toggling**: a `sudoers` rule restricted to
  `pmset disablesleep 0/1`, validated with `visudo -c`, removable at any time
- **Battery protection**: the session shuts off below a charge threshold
- Menu bar countdown and end-of-session notifications

### 🌡️ System monitor
- **Temperatures** for CPU, GPU and battery: the most relevant reading per
  component, straight from the SMC
- **Hardware usage**: CPU % and GPU %
- **Memory pressure** with a traffic-light indicator
  (green = normal, yellow = caution, red = critical) plus used/total memory

### 🖱️ Mouse scrolling
- Inverts the **mouse wheel only**; the trackpad keeps macOS natural scrolling
- Applies instantly, no restart, no kernel extension

### 🪟 Window switcher
- Replaces **⌘Tab** with a grid showing every window as a live thumbnail,
  not just app icons
- **Browser tabs are first-class**: each Safari/Chrome/Edge/Brave/Vivaldi tab is
  its own entry, and ⌘Tab toggles between two tabs of the same browser just like
  between two apps (real most-recently-used order, at tab granularity)
- Instant: a quick flick switches with no UI; the window raises immediately
- Hold ⌘ and tap Tab to cycle; Shift/← goes back; release to switch; **Q** quits
  the highlighted app; Esc cancels. Fluid, animated, Mission Control & Spaces friendly
- Falls back gracefully to app icons when Screen Recording is not granted

### 🎚️ Per-app volume mixer
- Set each app's volume individually, something macOS doesn't offer
  (CoreAudio process taps, macOS 14.4+; nothing is recorded)
- Every app holding an audio connection appears, with a live indicator for the
  ones playing now; volumes persist per app, and 100% = untouched audio

### ✂️ Cut & paste files in Finder
- Press **⌘X** to cut the current Finder selection and **⌘V** to move it into
  the folder you're viewing
- Handles multiple files and folders; a floating HUD shows what's held and
  confirms the move. Text fields keep their normal ⌘X / ⌘V

### ❌ Quit on last window close
- When an app's last window closes, the app quits and frees its memory
- Apps that run window-less are never touched, and a per-app exception list
  keeps any app you choose running

### 🗑️ Complete app uninstaller
- Drag an app in (or pick one) to find the caches, preferences, logs, containers
  and other files it leaves behind, each with its size
- Review the list, then move the selected items to the Trash (reversible, never a
  hard delete) and see the space recovered

### 📥 Temporary shelf
- A floating spot to gather files, images, text and links, then drag them back
  out into any app, window or Space later
- Summon it at the cursor with **⌃⌥⌘D** or by shaking the mouse mid-drag; no
  permissions required

> The utilities above are optional. Configure each one during onboarding or in
> **Settings › Features**, where every feature has its own page.

## Install

### Download (recommended)
Grab the latest DMG from [**Releases**](https://github.com/vorssaint/vorssaint-utils/releases),
open it and drag **Vorssaint Utils** into **Applications**.

> Releases are signed with a stable self-signed certificate (no paid Apple
> Developer ID), so granted permissions persist across updates. Gatekeeper
> still flags the first launch. Right-click the app → **Open**, or clear the
> quarantine flag:
> `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Vorssaint Utils.app"`

### Build from source
```sh
git clone https://github.com/vorssaint/vorssaint-utils.git
cd vorssaint-utils
./build.sh            # compile, generate the icon, assemble the signed bundle
./build.sh --install  # same + install into /Applications and launch
```

### Requirements
- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or newer
- Apple Silicon
- Xcode Command Line Tools (to build from source)

### Uninstall
```sh
./Tools/uninstall.sh   # from a clone, or download it from the repo
```
It quits the app, unregisters the login item, resets its Accessibility and
Screen Recording permissions, deletes the app, preferences and saved state,
and removes the optional closed-lid `sudoers` rule, leaving nothing behind.
Or just drag the app to the Trash and run
`tccutil reset All com.vorssaint.utils` to clear its permissions.

## Permissions

Everything is optional: features degrade gracefully and the onboarding walks
you through each grant:

| Permission | Used by | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| **Accessibility** | Scroll inverter, switcher keyboard, cut & paste, quit on close | Those features stay off |
| **Screen Recording** | Window titles & thumbnails in the switcher | Switcher shows app icons only |
| **Notifications** | Session end & battery protection alerts | Silent operation |
| **Full Disk Access** (optional) | A more thorough uninstaller scan | Scans the accessible locations only |
| **Administrator** (once, optional) | Password-free closed-lid toggling | Password prompt per toggle |

The cut & paste and switcher-tabs features also ask macOS for Automation consent
the first time they talk to Finder or a browser. The shelf needs no permissions.

The first launch opens a guided onboarding (language, permissions, monitor tour
and an opt-in page for each feature). People updating from an earlier version
see a short what's-new pass once. Revisit it anytime from
**Settings › About › Review introduction**.

```

Strict separation: **UI** observes **services**; services never import SwiftUI.
Every user-facing string lives in `Core/Localization.swift`, compiler-checked
for both languages.

Diagnostics:
```sh
"/Applications/Vorssaint Utils.app/Contents/MacOS/VorssaintUtils" --selftest  # SELFTEST OK
"/Applications/Vorssaint Utils.app/Contents/MacOS/VorssaintUtils" --sensors   # SMC sensor dump
